# Hello! 👋
I’m **@ren1student**

👀 I am interested in writing all kinds of code, character design, and animation production. The process of bringing unique characters to life on the canvas and through digital animation, coupled with the logical challenges of coding, truly fascinates me. Whether it's crafting the perfect lines for a character or debugging a complex algorithm, each pursuit offers endless opportunities for creativity and learning.

🌱 I will continue to learn code, explore new character design styles, and master more advanced animation techniques. I believe continuous learning is the key to growth in these ever - evolving fields.

💞️ Let's learn and discuss the world together. Whether it’s sharing tips on optimizing code, exchanging ideas about character backstories, or talking about the latest trends in animation, I’m always up for a good conversation!
